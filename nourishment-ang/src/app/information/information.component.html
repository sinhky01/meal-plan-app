    <p class="card-text">The meal planning app, working title Nourishment, is our product idea for Project 2. The current goals of the product can be divided into two categories, the calendar and the meal sections of the app. The calendar will function as the general view for the user to see long term details about what food is scheduled for what days on either a monthly, weekly, or daily timescale. This brings in the elements of our meal planning aspects and the filtering that we have in mind for the product. The goal of the app is not specifically for dieting but rather a system of randomly suggesting desired food for the user. These recipes will come from both an internal system as well as user submitted recipes that the user can specify for themselves. The minimum viable product that we have in mind combines the utility of a very simple calendar function as well as offering a user-friendly UI to both view and submit randomly picked recipes. Possible stretch goals for this project include, further calorie sorting for the recipes, as well as detailed search menus to quickly include or green light recipes to be included for the user. </p>
